# Clojure-Hamcrest

A Clojure library inspired by [Java Hamcrest](http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/).
A specific aim of this library is to make usage for those familiar with the
Java version of Hamcrest as simple as possible.

## Usage

Intended for usage within a `clojure.test/deftest` expression.

Example REPL session:
```
(require '[com.plumbee.hamcrest.assert :refer [assert-that]])
=> nil
(require '[com.plumbee.hamcrest.matchers :refer :all])
=> nil
(assert-that 5 (greater-than 4))
=> nil
(assert-that 5 (greater-than 6))

FAIL in clojure.lang.PersistentList$EmptyList@1 (form-init3661951057044227532.clj:1)

expected: a number greater than <6>
  actual: was <5>
=> nil
```

For more examples, please see the tests.
